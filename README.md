Pointers have been a persistent trouble area in program proving.
Some of the fundamental issues are related to the problem of aliasing, 
support for local reasoning  and the technical challenge of constructing 
formal proofs with these structures. The purpose of this report is to 
provide an accessible exposition of the several ways that one can conduct,
explore and write correctness proofs of pointer programs with Hoare Logic 
and the Isabelle proof assistant.
